Alias Tips
==========

[Alias-tips][1] is a plugin to help remembering aliases you once defined. It works by trying to find an alias for the command you are currently trying to execute and printing a help line reminding you about that alias.

Options
-------

  - `ZSH_PLUGINS_ALIAS_TIPS_TEXT` changes default alias tip wording. This option can be set in runcom, e.g. `zstyle ":prezto:module:alias-tips" text "Alias tip: "`
